# Documentation for pyCHAMP

This directory the documentation for [pychamp](https://github.com/neelravi/pychamp).

## How to update documentation

The website is generated using [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/).
The [reStructuredText](http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html) sources are in the `sphinx` subdirectory, and executing `make` places the built website in `sphinx/_build/html`. 
Content of these files are generated automatically by executing sphinx. This is done by the Makefile included in the doc directory.
